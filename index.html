      <h2>Arjun Shah</h2>
    
        <p>I love math, reading, and building things</p>
        
        Some things about me:
        <ul>
            <li>Grew up in Westampton, NJ</li>
            <li>Went to the University of Pennsylvania where I studied Math and CIS</li>
            <li>Worked as a quant researcher at an options market making firm</li>
            <li>I've been training MMA for over a year and have done two fights</li>
            <li>Avid poker player - I read a lot of theory but also understand when theory fails</li>
            <li>Favorite Book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Life">A Little Life</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)">Siddhartha</a> </li>
            <li>Currently reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a></li>
        </ul>

        Work Experience:
        <ul>
            <li>Quant Researcher @ Korman Communities</li>

                <li><em>What they do</em>: Real estate investment firm</li>
                <li><em>What I did</em>: Designed and developed their data infrastructure; Worked on a variety of modeling and automation tasks for their property portfolio</li>
                <li><em>What I learned</em>: Smallest team I've worked on and the most responsibility I've had in a job. Felt like working at a startup as we had to build and move fast. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Quant Researcher @ Albatross Labs</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>What they do</em>: Options market-making firm</li>
                <li><em>What I did</em>: Worked on their pricing engine (how we go from bids/asks to theos) as well as a variety of side projects ranging from vol trading to low-latency code optimizations </li>
                <li><em>What I learned</em>: The most rewarding work experience I've had to date - learned how to build and iterate fast, write generalizable code, and optimize existing code for speed </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Software Engineer @ CaseCtrl</li>
            <ul>

                <li><em>What I did</em>: Worked on their analytics dashboard</li>
                <li><em>What I learned</em>: First official coding/engineering job; Hadn't worked on large scale projects before this so it gave me a taste for that level of complexity</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
    
        <!-- Some things I believe:
        <ul>
            <li>Theory fails - some examples</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Poker</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've played against people with a variety of ranges, from fishes that only play AA, AK, or KK, to quants that have memorized <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Poker-Bill-Chen/dp/1886070253">Bill Chen's Book</a></li>
                    <li>People are always exploitable, we make mistakes and it's your duty to punish them for theirs. I enjoy expanding my range into unnatural territories. Your mistakes - my mistakes = edge</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Failure is good as long as there are short cycle times between each of them</li>
            <ul>
                <li>(Apologies for being trite) It is okay to fail, but dwelling on failures and beating yourself up about them is futile</li>
            </ul>
            <li>99.9% of self-help books are nonsense</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Most self-help books can be summarized in a few paragraphs and the message/nuances of the book will not be diluted greatly</li>
                <li>These books aim to capitilize on those that want hits of motivation, rather those that are disciplined (or even obsessed)</li>
                <li>Fiction books are a better self-help tool - chain yourself to a character in a story and feel what they feel</li>
            </ul>
            <li> <em>Adding more later</em> </li>
        </ul>
